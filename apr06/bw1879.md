# Introduction
The papers this week cover 3 general topics:
* Weld -- End-to-End Optimization for Data Analytics
* Naiad -- A Timely Dataflow System
* Noria -- dynamic, partially-stateful data-flow for high-performance web applications

# Weld

## Introduction
Weld is a library that is a common runtime for data analytics libraries like numpy and panda that leads to performance improvements.

## Motivation
When a user executes a query on a DBMS, she can expect that the query will go through end-to-end optimization and execution. Yet when she works in Python, there might be several stages of data transfer between pandas, numpy, etc. This means that intermediate libraries get optimized while no end-to-end optimization takes place.

## Approaches

Weld lets libraries express their computations in an intermediate representation (IR), then maps that representation to the most effective machine code.

The IR is based on monad comprehensions, and is purely functional, meaning all variables are immutable. The data types are scalars, vectors, and dicts, with some builders and merger functions. Execution is lazy.

Weld works by defining WeldObject's in the python code which have operations done to them. The Weld optimizer then runs through the resulting operations and performs several optimizations, for instance by finding two map operations and performing them as one operation.

## Trade-Offs
Weld requires work for the developer; instead of using a numpy array, she must work with a weld array. It also requires significant upkeep from the weld team; new features in Pandas may not automattically be supported by weld. Finally although weld can work across libraries, it may not have the full optimization potential that's possible within a data processing framework: although weld might simplify some maps/reduces, it wouldn't be able to cache an index as in SQL (a software-specific optimization).

Despite all this, weld routinely sees runtime speedups of 5-10x, and is a good solution for the cross-library optimization problem.

## Open Questions and Future Work
One immediate concern is that when visiting weld's website, weld.rs, we can see that it's end of life. A one-size-fits-all runtime seems too much to maintain indefinitely.  A more manageable approach might be optimiztions within pairs of libraries; can tensorflow and numpy developers get together and make things easier for the python optimizer to make the same improvements that weld's was. Another is the growth of frameworks; tensorflow has a dataset object that does much of what pandas does, reducing the need for cross-library applications.
